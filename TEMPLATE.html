        <h1>The recipe name should be in H1 format.</h1>
            <!-- You can maybe put a little introductory paragraph here. 
                It should always be seperate from any important information such as allergen, vegan/vegetarian options, or otherwise.
                Typically, you might include details relating to the little things in creating the dish. For example; -->

            <p><i>Quality of the ingredients matters here. Oregano can be of store brand, but is better if you create it yourself.</i></p>
            
            <!-- Remember that you are free to reference other existing recipes in the repository with the <a> tag; 
                the idea is that this ends up being a closely-connected ecosystem of recipes from all places.

                Optionally, you can also specify some details about the dish itself, such as preparation time,
                cooking time and number of servings. The most concise way to do this is as follows: -->

            <ul>
                <li>Preparation time: <b>15 min</b></li>
                <li>Cooking time: <b>~25 min</b></li>
                <li>Servings: <b>5</b></li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Sections should be in H2 format, and follow this order:</h2>
        <h2>Important Details:</h2>

            <!-- Place information about allergens, vegan/vegetarian compatibility and/or 
                cultural/religious notices: (for example: contains pork) here. 
                Some examples have been listed below: -->

            <ul>
                <li>Vegan/Vegetarian: <b>Neither/Vegan/Vegetarian</b></li>
                <li>Potential Allergens: <b>Nuts/Milk/Dairy/etc</b></li>
                <li>Kosher: <b>Yes/No</b></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <!-- Pretty self-explanatory; list ingredients here. They should be unordered (<ul>).
                For consistency's sake, aim to use the following abbreviations where possible:
                
                tablespoon(s) -> tbsp.
                teaspoon(s) -> tsp.
                pound(s) -> lb(s).
                ounce(s) -> oz.
                gram(s) -> g

                For denominations such as size (i.e. large, )
                Write fractions in the format &fracxy, where x is the numerator and y the denominator.
                for example, 1/2 would be %frac12 - this is a nice way of formatting things and visual
                consistency is always a good thing. 
                
                Optional ingredients can be simply stated with (optional).-->
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta, 2 tbsps.</li>

        <h2>References</h2>
            
            <p>If you've referred to/transcribed any resources from other websites/creators/etc, cite them here under the following format in order of use:</p>
            <!-- You CAN forgo this section in favor of simply using <a> on text in the recipe itself, 
                but doing it this way appears neat and allows readers to easily collate information. 
                If you do it this way, make sure to use the <sub> tag to number your references in subscript where they occur.

                When numbering your references, you can also use the <a> tag on the number itself to refer to
                another part of the HTML document itself - to do it here, simply use the 'id' tag on part of 
                your reference and use #<id> in an <a> section linked to the subscripted number. An example has been mentioned in the
                'Directions' section above, and the below reference is given the id 'reference1'. -->
