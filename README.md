Looking for a place that stores all kinds of student recipes? Well you've found it! This is an open source project started by one of our members, [**Jordan**](https://github.com/jordanofoster). The project is inspired by [**LukeSmithxyz's**](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/based.cooking) project.  

The purpose of this project and repo is to compile various cooking recipes, methodologies and techniques from students at Nottingham Trent University. This repository is maintained and supported by members of [**NTU DevSoc**](https://devsoc.co.uk/).

If you're using github, make sure to check ![CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/ntu-cookbook/CONTRIBUTING.md).
=======
If you're reading this document, then it's (somewhat!) safe to assume that you're familiar(ish) with git, and working with github repositories. In that case:

1. If you haven't already, install git. Create a new folder called `ntu-cookbook` on your computer and write `git clone https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/ntu-cookbook.git` while in that directory you've just created.
2. Make sure you're on the `new-recipes` repository (`git checkout new-recipes`) and pull the repository to a directory using `git pull`.
3. Create a new branch named after your recipe (`git checkout -b [branch-name]`) and make sure to follow these guidelines:
     - Create a new folder within the `recipes` directory with the name of your recipe (e.g. `recipes/omelette`).
     - Within this folder, create the `assets` folder (to store multimedia), and copy `TEMPLATE.html` into this directory. 
4. Begin working on your new recipe by editing the template.    
   - Remember to place any images or other media into the assets folder and refer to them within your HTML page's code.
5. Push the changes to the remote branch (`git push -u https://github.com/NTUDevSoc/ntu-cookbook [branch-name]`)
6. Create a pull request on github requesting for your branch to be merged with the `new-recipes` repository, where it will be reviewed and integrated into the main website.

If you're not technically inclined, you can still contribute by writing your recipe into a form at `PUT FORM DOMAIN HERE` - we will be able to take it from there and implement it into the site.

### How do I use this?

The easiest way to access this is through our *github pages* website: https://devsoc.co.uk/ntu-cookbook/, where you can navigate through the recipes people have contributed as you would any other website.

If you'd like to keep these websites locally accessible, you have a few options; A webpage can be printed by pressing *CTRL+P* on your browser, or you can download the individual recipes by clicking the *Download ZIP* option in the github repository, like so;
